Skin Mole Classification


In this project, malignant skin moles are detected using object detection. This is an important task as it can aid in the early detection of skin cancer, which can lead to better treatment outcomes and improved patient survival rates. By automating the detection process, the system can also help reduce diagnostic errors and improve the efficiency of cancer screening.
